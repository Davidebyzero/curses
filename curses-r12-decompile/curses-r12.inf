! 101068 (0x18acc): "The attics, full of low beams and awkward angles, begin here in a relatively tidy area which extends north, south and east. The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light."

Unfortunately, although he claimed to have hunted for evidence to the ends of the earth, he never could find a detail he wanted for volume I, and it was never published. Somehow, this typifies your family, and consulting this worthy book about your ancestors makes you realise what an uncanny knack they had for never quite achieving anything.^^Unless, of course, you count having an awful lot of children. So many Meldrews are listed here that you'll have to look them up individually."

! 102266 (0x18f7a): "I bet you didn't know that chocolate biscuit manufacturers are damned in perpetuity?  I'm afraid the chapters about that in the Old Testaments were lost, though, and now no-one can remember why."
! 102388 (0x18ff4): "Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep."

! 103158 (0x192f6): "The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south."
! 103288 (0x19378): "This is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them."
! 103398 (0x193e6): "The only doorway is back east."
! 103416 (0x193f8): "It is attached to the ceiling."
! 103432 (0x19408): "You bump your head on the cord hanging from the ceiling, for the umpteenth time."
! 103474 (0x19432): "When you can get this working, perhaps you should take it somewhere prominent."
! 103522 (0x19462): "The kind of black box which often sits on top of a camera, used to illuminate otherwise dim scenes. It has an openable compartment on the side, with room left inside for a battery and a timer mechanism (which seem to be optional extras)."
! 103660 (0x194ec): "A rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side."
! 103706 (0x1951a): "Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof. A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south."
! 103906 (0x195e2): "Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball."
! 103950 (0x1960e): "The ball is scratched and misted up."
! 103974 (0x19626): "Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating."
! 104118 (0x196b6): "From here, you can only squeeze back east to the observatory."
! 104154 (0x196da): "Don't bother reading or thinking about it. Nothing to do with your family."
! 104200 (0x19708): "A romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out."
! 104312 (0x19778): "~Coronets for the Cotton Girl~, by Miss Marie Swelldon, published London, 1912. It's all about the happy-go-lucky daughter of a Yorkshire mill owner and her adventures marrying into the aristocracy."
! 104446 (0x197fe): "My my, a golden age for clear, simple poetry. At last, the dreary obscurity of Tennyson, Kipling, and [frothing at the mouth] Hardy gives way..."
! 104546 (0x19862): "This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory."
! 104748 (0x1992c): "It has an on/off switch on the side, and a slot for holding whatever is to be projected. There is also a little dial on the back, perhaps for the focus."
! 104836 (0x19984): "This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark."
! 105014 (0x19a36): "some"
! 105018 (0x19a3a): "That is a difficult puzzle, yes."
! 105040 (0x19a50): "In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside."
! 105084 (0x19a7c): "In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door."
! 105118 (0x19a9e): "The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear."
! 105204 (0x19af4): "It might be handy, if only it could carry anything."
! 105238 (0x19b16): "Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambeze Expedition of 1882!"
! 105346 (0x19b82): "On second thoughts, now you look at more closely, it seems to be the rucksack you bought to go to Paris with five years ago."
! 105422 (0x19bce): "A secret door stands open in the south wall!"
! 105448 (0x19be8): "The secret door is closed."
! 105464 (0x19bf8): "This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something..."
! 105558 (0x19c56): "Carry this with you everywhere you go."
! 105582 (0x19c6e): "A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall."
! 105650 (0x19cb2): "It used to hang in the downstairs landing, and the red, deranged eyes annoyed everybody who passed. Then Aunt Jemima picked up the ridiculous idea that it was by Sir Joshua Reynolds and had it valued. Happily it wasn't and, to cut a long story long, it ended up here."
! 105810 (0x19d52): "There is a big iron fireplace in the west wall."
! 105836 (0x19d6c): "The skylight above is open, and the sky does indeed light the room."
! 105874 (0x19d92): "Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle."
! 105908 (0x19db4): "It was painted out black during the first wave of Zeppelin air raids in World War I. This is completely irrelevant, but you did ask."
! 105990 (0x19e06): "The cork filters have gone. It's useless now."
! 106020 (0x19e24): "This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south."
! 106238 (0x19efe): "William Wordsworth once described poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity. If so, hospitals must be full of people turning out verses about what it was like to fall off the roof of a high building. Perhaps it might be better not to join them."
! 106394 (0x19f9a): "The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.^^It is peculiarly cold here."
! 106600 (0x1a068): "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
! 106630 (0x1a086): "Unfortunately, what you need this for is a very long way away."
! 106670 (0x1a0ae): "He is dressed in a grey shadow of Georgian finery."
! 106704 (0x1a0d0): "The chimney is cramped, sooty, unpleasant and has no floor to speak of, so you are held up only by jamming your feet against the walls. To the east, through the fireplace, is the cupboard."
! 106818 (0x1a142): "Not a chance!"
! 106828 (0x1a14c): "Wedged loosely in beside you is a sooty old stick."
! 106860 (0x1a16c): "It's exactly what it seems."
! 106878 (0x1a17e): "Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney."
! 107098 (0x1a25a): "An open hatch-door in the floor reveals a chute leading down into darkness."
! 107146 (0x1a28a): "Low down on one wall is a little hatch door, which if it were open would be large enough to enter."
! 107204 (0x1a2c4): "Perhaps the attic key might unlock it?  It does look modern compared to everything else here."
! 107260 (0x1a2fc): "The really good research was in his earlier years."
! 107292 (0x1a31c): "The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book."
! 107334 (0x1a346): "Despite appearances, this is not a prayer book after all but is Mad Isaac's diary of supernatural investigations!  The script is cursive and cursory as he rambles on through all those theories about the Curse. There's so much of it that you'd better just look up particular years."
! 107510 (0x1a3f6): "A pleasantly furnished, if now mildewed, box room. There are engravings of Alison's heroines: Christina Rossetti, Elizabeth Browning, Emily Dickinson and Queen Victoria, an unlikely quartet. The wallpaper is done out in a dice motif, and a square outline of sixes surrounds a rather small door leading back north into the attics.^^The room is provided with a comfortable bed, which looks very inviting."
! 107762 (0x1a4f2): "There's just the secret north door, unless of course you count the windows."
! 107806 (0x1a51e): "Black-latticed windows open on a beautiful summer's day."
! 107846 (0x1a546): "Blue sky can be seen through south-facing windows, latticed with black lead and shut tight."
! 107902 (0x1a57e): "A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's windows, offering fresh air, blue skies and a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway in the distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north."
! 108072 (0x1a628): "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
! 108102 (0x1a646): "The balcony is only a foot or so beneath the window-sill, and only about four feet square."
! 108158 (0x1a67e): "Gold and lead are naturally related, so you want to find a lead box to open."
! 108206 (0x1a6ae): "This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east."
! 108356 (0x1a744): "Faded ink on the label reads: Elderberry '63."
! 108388 (0x1a764): "It's provided for your torch, and not for anything else."
! 108422 (0x1a786): "On the side is the word ~Achtung~."
! 108444 (0x1a79c): "Purely decorative."
! 108458 (0x1a7aa): "The good news is that it has excellent grid references, which are easy to look up. The bad news is that it is a map of central Hamburg."
! 108538 (0x1a7fa): "A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on."
! 108642 (0x1a862): "The only doorway is back west to the winery."
! 108666 (0x1a87a): "There is a concealed safety catch (poorly) hidden on the wheel."
! 108706 (0x1a8a2): "the old"
! 108710 (0x1a8a6): "Inside the dark shaft is the old dumbwaiter."
! 108736 (0x1a8c0): "Uninviting."
! 108744 (0x1a8c8): "The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here."
! 108790 (0x1a8f6): "It isn't even mentioned in any of the books I've read."
! 108824 (0x1a918): "The half which didn't get the wish, actually."
! 108850 (0x1a932): "A steel wrench gathers dust in the corner."
! 108876 (0x1a94c): "Halfway up, or else halfway down, and a dreary place it is too: nothing but a dark corridor leading north."
! 108942 (0x1a98e): "A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger."
! 109030 (0x1a9e6): "At the north end is a metal door, standing open."
! 109058 (0x1aa02): "At the north end is a closed metal door."
! 109082 (0x1aa1a): "Cobwebbed old cellars. There is nothing to see except an opening in one wall onto a dark shaft, and a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel beside it with a handle on. The cellar continues west and south."
! 109206 (0x1aa96): "There is a concealed safety catch on the wheel axle."
! 109238 (0x1aab6): "Uninviting."
! 109246 (0x1aabe): "A plain old piece of timber."
! 109266 (0x1aad2): "It can't even follow orders."
! 109286 (0x1aae6): "In one corner is a dust-covered robot mouse."
! 109316 (0x1ab04): "Remember the late 1970s, when a craze for home-made robots swept the home computing world?  No, perhaps not, but here is a left-over from it anyway. The mouse is quite large (almost a foot wide and tall), and has a big smile painted on its metal chassis. It has surprisingly modern circuitry in, though, and is even humming very faintly, so someone must have put some work in on it recently."
! 109560 (0x1abf8): "The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you."
! 109738 (0x1acaa): "It isn't the attic key, I fear."
! 109758 (0x1acbe): "Lying where the mouse dropped it is a small brass key."
! 109790 (0x1acde): "The west end of a disused and shadowy old cellar. It used to be a wine cellar, but was bricked up when you were a child - you never did find out why. Perhaps the golden, jewelled staircase leading down into smoky mists to the south might be something to do with it."
! 109950 (0x1ad7e): "In the northwest wall the iron door stands open."
! 109976 (0x1ad98): "In the northwest wall is a heavy, imposing Gothic iron door."
! 110012 (0x1adbc): "An eerie, dark cave carved from crystal icicles of rock and strewn with great spiders' webs hung from the ragged stone, inhabited only by dead white insects. A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.^^The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.^^You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking for must be somewhere near here."
! 110318 (0x1aeee): "This used to be called the Conservatory, before Aunt Jemima took it over to potter about with plants, painting and indeed (on occasion) pottery. She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.^^An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.^^Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west."
! 110668 (0x1b04c): "A space about six feet square. The old drying racks now contain odd ceramic sculptures almost but not quite unrecognisable as coffee mugs. One corner is filled with an enormous pile of tie-dyed sheets, from Aunt Jemima's infamous Sixties Revival period of last October."

! 111252 (0x1b294): "She's been fiddling about with those cut flowers all afternoon. And she's a bit upset at being left alone in the house while you're off on holiday, so best not to get on her bad side. You really ought to make it up to her somehow."
! 111390 (0x1b31e): "Aunt Jemima, who has for years collected varieties of daisy, is engaged in her regular annual pastime of deciding which species make the best chains."
! 111476 (0x1b374): "Dangerous to wear. But at least any sort of daisies will do."
! 111518 (0x1b39e): "It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."
! 111732 (0x1b474): "This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent."
! 111942 (0x1b546): "This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs."
! 112070 (0x1b5c6): "An absolute essential."
! 112086 (0x1b5d6): "On the table is a heavy iron mascot of some kind."

! 112174 (0x1b62e): "You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it."
! 112408 (0x1b718): "A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out..."
! 112530 (0x1b792): "In the lush, verdant (which is to say, under-cared for) gardens of Meldrew House, where a stream gurgles pleasantly as it meanders through reeds. The house rises up high above you to the south and you do not dare go east for fear of being recaptured by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens."

To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew House Maze. A signpost reading ~To the Mosaic~ points east across the lawn."
! 113042 (0x1b992): "Several hundred years of rolling have made this a rather fine patch of grass, between the privet hedge (north), the plane tree (west) and the mosaic (east). Unfortunately, it is adorned with all the really ugly ornaments (gnomes, plaster nymphs, stone windmills to grow flowers in), this being the corner of the garden least visible from the house."

! 113264 (0x1ba70): "This sunken corner of the garden has been excavated and then covered over with tough perspex to protect it from visitor's shoes. It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life. There was probably a villa on this site, but your family has never been keen on archaeologists so the excavations went no further."
! 113492 (0x1bb54): "From here you can only climb back up to the lawn."
! 113520 (0x1bb70): "A clearing at the edge of the garden, surrounded by walls and the privet hedges of the maze. To the east is the plane tree, to the west an opening in the wall makes a garage entrance and to the south is a small vegetable garden."

! 114214 (0x1be26): "A magnificent view of the gardens would be yours, were it not for the branches and leaves which surround you. You can make out Aunt Jemima up at the conservatory window, but hide from her view. Down below, the privet-hedge layout of the maze can be seen through the lower branches."

! 114662 (0x1bfe6): "The south wall forms a giant bronze mural, which has stood the test of time."
! 114706 (0x1c012): "The mural depicts an old bearded wise man following a star in the western sky. He has his right arm around an attractive young woman and holds a bundle of wands with his left hand. Around the border are astrological symbols of all kinds, from Tarot suits to zodiacal constellations."
! 114874 (0x1c0ba): "An eerie passage, running down from an opening at the north to murky depths in the south. The walls are jagged, uneven and decorated with bones. An unpleasantly stale, charnel odour drifts in through a gap to the west."
! 115006 (0x1c13e): "Well, perhaps ~sarcophagus~ is a little melodramatic, but it's that kind of moment. You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place."
! 115148 (0x1c1cc): "A large, grisly cave, deep under the garden, dimly lit and eerie. Darkness curls around the natural pillars of rock like a mist: and there is a peculiar, vaguely familiar odour to it. The only obvious routes out are an uneven passage climbing to the north and a crawl west."
! 115314 (0x1c272): "You bumped into something unpleasant there."
! 115340 (0x1c28c): "The cartoonist Heath Robinson used to specialise in drawings of fantastically complicated machines of string, pulleys, levers, counterweights, cogs, mice running about on wheels and the like. Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.^^The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east."
! 115636 (0x1c3b4): "The whole     wall is occupied by a bronze mirror, reflecting the room."
! 115680 (0x1c3e0): "The north edge of the room is a big sheet of dull amber-coloured metal."
! 115724 (0x1c40c): "Someone rather good-looking (you can't help thinking) is reflected in the metal surface."
! 115780 (0x1c444): "A treasure in every sense, but misted over, like condensation on a cold window. Odd shapes seem visible through the haze: a horse's head, castle walls, a priest's crook."
! 115886 (0x1c4ae): "Sitting on the grass, beside the well, is a glowing golden orb."
! 115924 (0x1c4d4): "You half-stand, half-float in a golden, misty sphere perhaps ten yards across, which slowly spins. The centre, out of reach and somehow insubstantial, is an eight-by-eight lattice of oblong crystals, bathed in warm pearly light."
! 116066 (0x1c562): "You really should try to be more awestruck, for this is Merlin's cave, the hub of Creation. Every visitor perceives this place differently, according to his or her own myths and beliefs. Your particular creed being science, it is an unimpressive collection of gauges, dials and machines. An aluminium staircase leads up."
! 116268 (0x1c62c): "The lower, on, position is labelled ~Determinism~. The upper, off, position is labelled ~Chance~."
! 116332 (0x1c66c): "This flagstoned rampart on the hillside looks across the valley, down (unfortunately) to the motorway below. Coaches pass by, reminding you of the rapidly approaching time when visitors will have to be let in again for the summer. The only safe way to go is back east into the maze. To one side is a plaque."
! 116512 (0x1c720): "The hillside is too steep."
! 116528 (0x1c730): "A miniature plastic etching rests on the plaque."
! 116560 (0x1c750): "What's the point of a drawing so small it might almost be a playing card?"
! 116604 (0x1c77c): "No larger than a playing card, it depicts the Folly which used to stand on the hillside outcrop."
! 116660 (0x1c7b4): "This is a rampart on the hillside, a natural ledge leading east. Down below in the valley, rough cottages surround a church. Labourers toil in the fields, and a hay wain is being pulled across the river.^^Towering over you is a monstrously awful piece of architecture, a Folly. The freestanding tower has no appreciable purpose and no apparent entrance. The latter is just as well since it looks extremely unsafe."

! 117010 (0x1c912): "At the top of the beanstalk, in amongst the clouds. There is no safe way to go from here except back down, not surprisingly. A dangerous way might be to step out onto the clouds to the north, but even if this is a fairy-tale it would be taking a lot on trust."

! 117182 (0x1c9be): "A square grid of plots of grass and seedbeds, all alike."
! 117218 (0x1c9e2): "Capability Meldrew and his gang of workmen are delicately planting a sapling plane tree here. Your disturbance annoys them immensely and you are immediately arrested for vagrancy and theft. After a few months in prison, you are hauled up before the County Assizes and sentenced..."
! 117388 (0x1ca8c): "A long hall, deserted after nightfall, dimly lit by distant sodium street-lamps. Outside it is a stormy October night, and rain beats against the windowpanes. Shadows swoop and dive in the air like bats."

! 117962 (0x1ccca): "This is a city side street, but as if seen through the grey of despair. People stream by, some of whom you almost recognise, as if dead. The street runs east-west, and to the north is a doorway into a grubby tenement building."
! 118102 (0x1cd56): "This shambolic flat, which extends to the east, shares a filthy hallway with the one upstairs. To the south, passers-by pass by along the street. Peeling-away posters have been stuck up on top of each other on the walls, in such a way that you can only read the most recent."

! 118414 (0x1ce8e): "Flats occupied by starving-but-noble artists can be romantic and stylish despite the squalor. This one, however, is simply a one-room hovel, caked with paint, littered with brushes and improvised easels, and you can't help standing on tiptoe here."
! 118566 (0x1cf26): "The stairs end at a shabby room, with screened windows, lit by incense sticks and sevenbranched candelabra. A doorway with a hanging bead curtain leads west. In the centre of the room is a table, on which is an electric bell push and a wicked Tarot pack."
! 118718 (0x1cfbe): "She has a bad cold, but nevertheless is known to be the wisest woman in Europe."

! 119570 (0x1d312): "Every now and then he whimpers."
! 119590 (0x1d326): "The hollow man mechanically says: ~Where to, guv'nor?  Me with my big mouth, I gone and done it again, calling you the guv'nor. I was down Margate Sands way once, had a bloke come on board, he thought any old destination would do, like a real place, like anywhere was real... We are the hollow men, I says, he didn't like that... Hurry up, please, it's time.~"
! 119822 (0x1d40e): "A dry, desolate waste of buildings borders here on a main road, so full of black-suited pedestrians off to work at banks that you can't force your way any further east. Once in a while a few of the bowler-hatted army step into the street and down some steps below a Metropolitan sign."

! 120432 (0x1d670): "This crowded, bohemian cafe bears only a passing resemblance to the ruined castle of the Tarot card: the decor imitates castle walls and arrowslits. You find yourself sitting at a table for one in the centre of the cafe floor. It is noisy, bustling and cheery, and a string quartet plays Strauss under the chattering of German voices. Your chances of attracting a waiter are very slight."

! 123388 (0x1e1fc): "This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh."
! 123508 (0x1e274): "Hanging up on an iron bracket is a flaming torch."
! 123540 (0x1e294): "It is a summary of the writings of a polemical monk called Gildas, and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then only to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur."
! 124040 (0x1e488): "An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely fastened rope hanging down into the darkness."
! 124158 (0x1e4fe): "The crags are too precipitous."
! 124178 (0x1e512): "You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not friendly."
! 124320 (0x1e5a0): "Up and down are it, quite frankly."
! 124344 (0x1e5b8): "A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the crags."
! 124384 (0x1e5e0): "The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.^^It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation."
! 124672 (0x1e700): "The hillside is too steep."
! 124688 (0x1e710): "You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door."
! 124980 (0x1e834): "A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here, to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at the lowest point of the tiled roof."
! 125170 (0x1e8f2): "The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north."
! 125298 (0x1e972): "Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-like pole."
! 125352 (0x1e9a8): "The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight."
! 125566 (0x1ea7e): "The four quarters show white-beards in the Forum, farmers in Italian fields, a military fortification and a grain ship unloading at Ossia."
! 125652 (0x1ead4): "Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent."

! 125826 (0x1eb82): "What was once the villa's triclinium, or kitchen, is now deserted and long since ransacked for metal. (Nobody lives on their own in this century, and this villa wouldn't be easy to defend.)  A doorway to the east gives onto the atrium."
! 125972 (0x1ec14): "The well has a hinged wooden cover. You can't tell by looking how deep it is."
! 126018 (0x1ec42): "The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in diameter. It is very dark inside."
! 126086 (0x1ec86): "In one corner is a hinged wooden cover of some kind, which is shut."
! 126130 (0x1ecb2): "You are clinging perilously to the walls of the deep and dangerous well. You can hardly see a thing, even with the aid of the torch, but curiously enough you feel warm air blowing across you from the east."
! 126242 (0x1ed22): "Too risky. There might not be anything that way, for all you know."
! 126282 (0x1ed4a): "This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.^^A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came."
! 126532 (0x1ee44): "The log fires are hot, and anyway the only way out large enough for you is back west."
! 126582 (0x1ee76): "A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew House will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded."
! 126822 (0x1ef66): "Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent."
! 127000 (0x1f018): "This tent doesn't seem to have an exit, either."
! 127028 (0x1f034): "He is dishevelled, wiry and unconscious. He is also covered with dust and leaves, as if he has been lying down on his front outdoors for hours."
! 127116 (0x1f08c): "An unconscious Saxon spy is slumped on the ground. Occasionally faint noises can be heard from him."
! 127176 (0x1f0c8): "Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim."
! 127386 (0x1f19a): "Far, far too risky."
! 127400 (0x1f1a8): "An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals."
! 127508 (0x1f214): "You stand beside the eerie dolmen, surrounded by the terrible noises and incantations of a druidic rite."
! 127570 (0x1f252): "Far, far too risky."
! 127584 (0x1f260): "Resting on top of the dolmen is a polished blue stone."
! 127618 (0x1f282): "Hell, you always imagined, would contain fiery, sulphurous pits and a great many gentlemen with forked tails. You were right about the last part. A demon is sitting behind a flame-proofed desk at the bottom of the stairs. There are some disconcerting screams from further away, but nothing to worry about. Not in this life, anyway."

An angel is sitting here behind some new office furniture, next to a blue Tourist Information sign. A bridge of cloud extends south across the sky to the beanstalk. There is some choral singing going on somewhere, but not loud enough for you to hear properly. Not in this life, anyway."
