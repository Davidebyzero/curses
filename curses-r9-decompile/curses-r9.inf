There are about 725 English words understood by ~Curses~, so most reasonable synonyms are allowed.^^To pick something up, ~take thing~ and to drop it again, ~drop thing~. To see what you have, type ~take inventory~ or just ~inventory~. You can move about with commands such as ~go west~, or just ~west~ for short. (It is assumed that you are blessed with an excellent sense of direction.)^^", "Some commands can act on more than one thing. You can ~drop all~, which will drop everything (except things you're wearing), for instance. Or if you found a packing case with a number of things in, you could type such things as:^^    remove everything but the blue key^    get all the coins except ten, twenty and fifty^^(Containers may also be emptied or emptied into each other.)  If you are not explicit enough, sometimes the game can infer what you mean, but at other times it will ask for further details.

If there had been two blue keys you might reasonably have meant, it would reply with something like^^    Which do you mean, the blue doorkey or the Blue Moon Agency key?^^You may either tell it which, or else give up and do something else instead. If you don't mind which key, you can always say something such as:^^    drop a key into the slot^^and the game will make a sensible choice and tell you what it was.^^", "~Curses~ sometimes assumes commands which you implicitly make, but always tells you what they are in brackets. For instance:^^    >look up bach in book^    (first taking the Encyclopaedia of Composers)^    (putting the tuning fork in the rucksack to make room)^    ~J. S. Bach (1685-1750) had a pet aardvark called Nigel...^^", "~it~ refers to the last thing manipulated and ~again~ repeats the last command.^^You can ~save~, ~restore~ or ~restart~ the game at any time, or indeed ~quit~ or ask for your ~score~, which also tells the time and thus will be consulted every so often by alert players. ~fullscore~ or ~full~ gives a breakdown of the score. As an aide-memoire the command ~objects~ tells you where you left things you once had, and ~places~ says where you have been. ", "If you want to check that your copy of the game file is intact (and not, for instance, corrupted by some file-transfer process you used to get it), you can ~verify~ it. These commands do not take up any game time, and nor does anything the game didn't understand.^^", "Some jaundiced players tire of long descriptions of places, and they can type ~short~ (or ~superbrief~) to make the game only give short ones. Amnesiac players, on the other hand, may like to use ~long~ (or ~verbose~) to give only long ones. Either kind can go back to the usual state of affairs with ~normal~ (or ~brief~).^^", "Simple typing mistakes can sometimes be corrected just by typing ~oops~ followed by the word you had intended to type, so for instance:^^    drop fish in buket^    oops bucket^^The game knows several useful abbreviations: i for inventory, ne for northeast (and so on), l for look, g for again, o for oops, x for examine, z for wait (short for ~zzz~ - sorry about that).^^", "You can sometimes enter larger objects you find. You might well be able to get in a tractor, for instance, though driving it around might be harder.^^", "From time to time, you will wish to speak to other people. If you only have a single word to say, you could use commands like^^    answer yes^    say boo to goose^^(Text in quotation marks is not allowed.)  The game will usually guess who you want to talk to if you miss off the name. A better way to talk, which allows more complicated remarks, is to use commands such as^", "^    goose, boo^    wine waiter, give me the bill^^though, of course, the waiter may have better things to do.^Some documents may be consulted in this game. For this, try commands such as^^    look up chlorine^    consult periodic table about argon^^", "There are, of course, many other commands for more specialised circumstances.
