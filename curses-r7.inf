Bach (1685-1750) had a pet aardvark called Nigel...^^", "~it~ refers to the last thing manipulated and ~again~ repeats the last command.^^You can ~save~, ~restore~ or ~restart~ the game at any time, or indeed ~quit~ or ask for your ~score~, which also tells the time and thus will be consulted every so often by alert players. ~fullscore~ or ~full~ gives a breakdown of the score. As an aide-memoire the command ~objects~ tells you where you left things you once had, and ~places~ says where you have been. These commands do not take up any game time, and nor does anything the game didn't understand.^^", "Some jaundiced players get tired of the long descriptions of places, and they can type ~short~ (or ~superbrief~) to make the game only give short ones. Amnesiac players, on the other hand, may like to use ~long~ (or ~verbose~) to give only long ones. Either kind can go back to the usual state of affairs with ~normal~ (or ~brief~).^^", "Simple typing mistakes can sometimes be corrected just by typing ~oops~ followed by the word you had intended to type, so for instance:^^    drop fish in buket^    oops bucket^^The game knows several useful abbreviations: i for inventory, ne for northeast (and so on), l for look, g for again, o for oops, x for examine, z for wait (short for ~zzz~ - sorry about that).^^", "You can sometimes enter larger objects you find. You might well be able to get in a tractor, for instance, though driving it around might be harder.^^", "From time to time, you will wish to speak to other people. If you only have a single word to say, you could use commands like^^    answer yes^    say boo to goose^^(Text in quotation marks is not allowed.)  The game will usually guess who you want to talk to if you miss off the name. A better way to talk, which allows more complicated remarks, is to use commands such as^", "^    goose, boo^    wine waiter, give me the bill^^though, of course, the waiter may have better things to do.^Some documents may be consulted in this game. For this, try commands such as^^    look up chlorine^    consult periodic table about argon^^", "There are, of course, many other commands for more specialised circumstances. A final word of warning: cursing is strictly forbidden in this game.";

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light."

Unfortunately, although he claimed to have hunted for evidence to the ends of the earth, he never could find a detail he wanted for volume I, and it was never published. Somehow, this typifies your family, and consulting this worthy book about your ancestors makes you realise what an uncanny knack they had for never quite achieving anything.^^Unless, of course, you count having an awful lot of children. So many Meldrews are listed here that you'll have to look them up individually."

! 88680 (0x15a68): "Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep."

! 89594 (0x15dfa): "The air is dusty and warm, almost making you choke in this rather empty area. The attic turns from northwest to east, and there is also a tight doorway leading west. A short flight of wooden steps leads down and to the south."
! 89750 (0x15e96): "This is a roughly-furnished photographer's dark room, used by your grandfather years ago. There's nothing much here now, since you threw the chemicals out in case the children found them."

! 90028 (0x15fac): "The photograph is one of the very early ones which looks as if it was taken in the dark because the chemicals have gradually oxidised. The poor man in the frame (Mr Roger Meldrew, Esquire) looks as if he was propped up by a big clamp to hold him still for five minutes, and that's because he was."

! 90396 (0x1611c): "Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof. A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south."
! 90632 (0x16208): "Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball."

! 90708 (0x16254): "Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny."

! 90906 (0x1631a): "~Coronets for the Cotton Girl~, by Miss Marie Swelldon, published London, 1912. It's all about the happy-go-lucky daughter of a Yorkshire mill owner and her adventures marrying into the aristocracy."
! 91054 (0x163ae): "My my, a golden age for clear, simple poetry. At last, the dreary obscurity of Tennyson, Kipling, and [frothing at the mouth] Hardy gives way..."
! 91164 (0x1641c): "This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory."
! 91406 (0x1650e): "It has an on/off switch on the side, and a slot for holding whatever is to be projected."
! 91468 (0x1654c): "This tight annexe at the eastern end of the house is piled up with old loft insulation rolls, left over from the last time the job was done (whenever that was). A gap between the tiles of the roof (which you really must mend before winter) lets a little natural light in, but the attics to the west and south are dark."

! 91716 (0x16644): "In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside."
! 91766 (0x16676): "In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door."
! 91806 (0x1669e): "The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney-sweeping gear."
! 91908 (0x16704): "It might be handy, if only it could carry anything."
! 91944 (0x16728): "Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambeze Expedition of 1882!"
! 92068 (0x167a4): "On second thoughts, now you look at more closely, it seems to be the rucksack you bought to go to Paris with five years ago."
! 92154 (0x167fa): "A secret door stands open in the south wall!"
! 92186 (0x1681a): "The secret door is closed."
! 92206 (0x1682e): "This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something..."
! 92318 (0x1689e): "Carry this with you everywhere you go."
! 92346 (0x168ba): "A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall."
! 92426 (0x1690a): "It used to hang in the downstairs landing, and the red, deranged eyes annoyed everybody who passed. Then Aunt Jemima picked up the ridiculous idea that it was by Sir Joshua Reynolds and had it valued. Happily it wasn't and, to cut a long story long, it ended up here."
! 92616 (0x169c8): "There is a big iron fireplace in the west wall."
! 92650 (0x169ea): "The skylight above is open, and the sky does indeed light the room."
! 92698 (0x16a1a): "Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle."
! 92738 (0x16a42): "It was painted out black during the first wave of Zeppelin air raids in World War One. This is completely irrelevant, but you did ask."
! 92834 (0x16aa2): "The cork filters have gone. It's useless now."
! 92868 (0x16ac4): "This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south."
! 93122 (0x16bc2): "William Wordsworth once described poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity. If so, hospitals must be full of people turning out verses about what it was like to fall off the roof of a high building. Perhaps it might be better not to join them."
! 93294 (0x16c6e): "The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.^^It is peculiarly cold here."
! 93532 (0x16d5c): "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
! 93568 (0x16d80): "Unfortunately, what you need this for is a very long way away."
! 93612 (0x16dac): "He is dressed in a grey shadow of Georgian finery."
! 93648 (0x16dd0): "The chimney is cramped, sooty, unpleasant and has no floor to speak of, so you are held up only by jamming your feet against the walls. To the east, through the fireplace, is the cupboard."
! 93780 (0x16e54): "Not a chance!"
! 93790 (0x16e5e): "Wedged loosely in beside you is a sooty old stick."
! 93826 (0x16e82): "It's exactly what it seems."
! 93846 (0x16e96): "the"
! 93848 (0x16e98): "This is rather dangerous, I'm afraid. Use only on vegetative matter."
! 93898 (0x16eca): "Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney."
! 94146 (0x16fc2): "An open hatch-door in the floor reveals a chute leading down into darkness."
! 94198 (0x16ff6): "Low down on one wall is little hatch door, which if it were open would be large enough to enter."
! 94264 (0x17038): "Perhaps the attic key might unlock it?  It does look modern compared to everything else here."
! 94330 (0x1707a): "The really good research was in his earlier years."
! 94366 (0x1709e): "The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book."
! 94416 (0x170d0): "Despite appearances, this is not a prayer book after all but is Mad Isaac's diary of supernatural investigations!  The script is cursive and cursory as he rambles on through all those theories about the Curse. There's so much of it that you'd better just look up particular years."
! 94612 (0x17194): "A pleasantly furnished, if now mildewed, box room. A rather small door leads back north into the attics. The room is provided with a comfortable bed, which looks very inviting."
! 94736 (0x17210): "There's just the secret north door, unless of course you count the windows."
! 94790 (0x17246): "Black-latticed windows open on a beautiful summer's day."
! 94830 (0x1726e): "Blue skies can be seen through south-facing windows, latticed with black lead and shut tight."
! 94896 (0x172b0): "A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's windows, offering fresh air, blue skies and a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway in the distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north."
! 95092 (0x17374): "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
! 95128 (0x17398): "The balcony is only a foot or so beneath the window-sill, and only about four feet square."
! 95192 (0x173d8): "Gold and lead are naturally related, so you want to find a lead box to open."
! 95246 (0x1740e): "This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east."
! 95426 (0x174c2): "Faded ink on the label reads: Elderberry '63."
! 95462 (0x174e6): "It's provided for your torch, and not for anything else."
! 95502 (0x1750e): "On the side is the word ~Achtung~."
! 95528 (0x17528): "Purely decorative."
! 95542 (0x17536): "The good news is that it has excellent grid references, which are easy to look up. The bad news is that it is a map of central Hamburg."
! 95636 (0x17594): "A disused storage room off the winery. In one wall is an opening onto an ominous dark shaft, and beside it is a big Victorian-steam-engine style wheel with a handle on."
! 95754 (0x1760a): "The only doorway is back west to the winery."
! 95786 (0x1762a): "There is a concealed safety catch (poorly) hidden on the wheel."
! 95832 (0x17658): "the old"

! 95870 (0x1767e): "Uninviting."
! 95880 (0x17688): "the"
! 95882 (0x1768a): "The dumbwaiter hangs on strong pulley ropes which stretch up and down from here."
! 95938 (0x176c2): "It isn't even mentioned in any of the books I've read."
! 95978 (0x176ea): "The half which didn't get the wish, actually."
! 96012 (0x1770c): "Halfway up, or else halfway down, and a dreary place it is too: nothing but a dark corridor leading north."
! 96086 (0x17756): "A passage which slants very slightly down to the south, which is full of coal dust, to which you are unfortunately allergic. Not somewhere to linger."

! 96754 (0x179f2): "The bricking-up of this cellar seems incomplete, because there is a hole about ten or eleven inches across in the west wall. You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you."

A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.^^The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.^^You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking for must be somewhere near here."

She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.^^An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.^^Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west."

To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."

He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. A strange, more solid figure stands by a trestle table at the north end of the tent."

She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect."

None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it."

The house rises up high above you to the south and you do not dare go east for fear of being recaptured by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens."

To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew House Maze. A signpost reading ~To the Mosaic~ points east."

It consists of a time-worn Roman mosaic, divided into four quadrants, each showing scenes of idealised Roman life.

! 102700 (0x1912c): "The mural depicts an old bearded wise man following a star in the western sky. He has his right arm around an attractive young woman and holds a bundle of wands with his left hand. Around the border are astrological symbols of all kinds, from Tarot suits to zodiacal constellations."

! 110284 (0x1aecc): "The rather sparse rolling landscape is dominated here by a massive, and suspiciously unnatural, wall of thorns, which forms a great ring about an area perhaps a hundred yards in diameter. There are goat pastures to the north."
! 110440 (0x1af68): "There's only dull grassland that way."
! 110468 (0x1af84): "A ragged gap in the wall has been burnt out to the south."
! 110508 (0x1afac): "The wall rustles and clashes its thorns like a beast alive."
! 110550 (0x1afd6): "It's hard to imagine what could possibly shift a wall like that."
! 110596 (0x1b004): "Here inside the thorn wall, a north-south path leads across sacred earth into the imposing marble Temple of Zeus. You feel distinctly uneasy walking on such hallowed turf. There are any number of myths about gods getting cross about that sort of thing."
! 110772 (0x1b0b4): "The wall of thorns hems you in."
! 110794 (0x1b0ca): "The beautiful candle-lit Temple of Zeus, a cavern of marble pillars which is quite empty and featureless save for the entrance at the north. So much for all the rumours about hoards of treasure - it looks as if Zeus (who is, by the way howling with anger outside) was bluffing all along."
! 110994 (0x1b192): "Unfortunately for you (since Zeus is watching it), the temple has only one entrance."
! 111054 (0x1b1ce): "one"
! 111056 (0x1b1d0): "This currency is only valid in ancient Greece. Where on earth have you been?"
! 111110 (0x1b206): "A long walk along the cliffs from the lighthouse leads naturally here, just outside the Eraina Taverna, whose open doorway lies to the south."
! 111208 (0x1b268): "There's only dull grassland that way."
! 111236 (0x1b284): "A plain but cheery taverna, fill of miserable and rather ashamed men who are drinking retsina heavily. The day is dawning outside the north door, but they strangely do not share your uplifted feeling at the sight."
! 111382 (0x1b316): "The tavern entrance is to the north."
! 111408 (0x1b330): "A speciality dessert of the Taverna: ice cream, kateifi, raspberry sauce, cream. An acquired taste."
! 111480 (0x1b378): "Left untouched on one table is an Ekmek Special dessert."
! 111520 (0x1b3a0): "Better with chocolate ice cream, I think."
! 111550 (0x1b3be): "Doesn't somebody else need this more than you?"
! 111584 (0x1b3e0): "Morose and unconvivial at the best of times. This is not the best of times."
! 111638 (0x1b416): "Behind the bar, a depressed bartender polishes glasses."
! 111678 (0x1b43e): "You stand atop a pinnacle of stone, on an early Pharos, or lighthouse. Inconsiderately enough, the builders have provided no obvious way down from here. Still, there's a fine view out across the Mediterranean sea into the dim dawning sun. It's going to be a nice day, you can't help thinking.^^In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay. There seems to be very little traffic at the moment, though a smudge on the horizon might possibly be a quinquireme."
! 112050 (0x1b5b2): "Being a lighthouse, this pinnacle is way up in the air. Point taken?"
! 112100 (0x1b5e4): "This is a murky hillside cave, whose mouth opens to the northeast, though a tight squeeze might lead a little way west. Outside is a clear starry night. There is no traffic noise, and the air smells fresh."

! 112280 (0x1b698): "It is a summary of the writings of a polemical monk called Gildas, and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then only to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur."
! 112838 (0x1b8c6): "An uncomfortable spur of rock on the hillside crags. The only natural access to this spot is a crevice in the hill to the east, but there is also a securely fastened rope hanging down into the darkness."
! 112976 (0x1b950): "The crags are too precipitous."
! 112998 (0x1b966): "You are hanging perilously on a hemp rope, suspended from an overhang of rock above, which drops down into the darkness of the valley. On the tracks below, patrols of men can be heard, and you feel instinctively that they are not friendly."
! 113164 (0x1ba0c): "Up and down are it, quite frankly."
! 113190 (0x1ba26): "A single yellow daisy grows from a little tuft of grass on the crags."
! 113238 (0x1ba56): "The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.^^It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation."
! 113580 (0x1bbac): "The hillside is too steep."
! 113600 (0x1bbc0): "You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door."
! 113946 (0x1bd1a): "A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here, to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at the lowest point of the tiled roof."
! 114174 (0x1bdfe): "The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north."
! 114330 (0x1be9a): "Resting against one pillar is a horn made from a tusk, mounted on a long spear-like pole."

! 114394 (0x1beda): "The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight."
! 114648 (0x1bfd8): "The four quarters show white-beards in the Forum, farmers in Italian fields, a military fortification and a grain ship unloading at Ossia."
! 114746 (0x1c03a): "Whatever function this spacious room once had, now it is evidently home to military men, for it is filled with crude armour, spears, rough blankets which are little more than animal hides. Fortunately for you the guards are absent."
! 114906 (0x1c0da): "A crude six-sided die made from animal bone."
! 114938 (0x1c0fa): "a pair of"
! 114944 (0x1c100): "What was once the villa's triclinium, or kitchen, is now deserted and long since ransacked for metal. (Nobody lives on their own in this century, and this villa wouldn't be easy to defend.)  A doorway to the west gives onto the atrium."
! 115110 (0x1c1a6): "The well has a hinged wooden cover. You can't tell by looking how deep it is."
! 115166 (0x1c1de): "The hinged wooden cover is raised, revealing a circular well about a yard in diameter. It is very dark inside."
! 115244 (0x1c22c): "In one corner is a hinged wooden cover of some kind, which is shut."
! 115292 (0x1c25c): "You are clinging perilously to the walls of the deep and dangerous well. You can hardly see a thing, even with the aid of the torch, but curiously enough you feel warm air blowing across you from the west."
! 115434 (0x1c2ea): "Too risky. There might not be anything that way, for all you know."
! 115482 (0x1c31a): "This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works. A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof, but nowhere near enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came."
! 115784 (0x1c448): "The log fires are hot, and anyway the only way out large enough for you is back east."
! 115844 (0x1c484): "A well-flagstoned forecourt at the villa entrance, surrounded by lesser wooden buildings. Some of these are in use as stables, and figures of men slip between them. You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew House will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded."
! 116122 (0x1c59a): "Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent."
! 116336 (0x1c670): "This tent doesn't seem to have an exit, either."

! 116472 (0x1c6f8): "An unconscious Saxon spy is slumped on the ground. Occasionally faint noises can be heard from him."
! 116542 (0x1c73e): "Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim."
! 116794 (0x1c83a): "Far, far too risky."
! 116810 (0x1c84a): "An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals."
! 116938 (0x1c8ca): "You stand beside the eerie dolmen, surrounded by the terrible noises and incantations of a druidic rite."
! 117010 (0x1c912): "Far, far too risky."
! 117026 (0x1c922): "Resting on top of the dolmen is a polished blue stone."
! 117064 (0x1c948): "Hell, you always imagined, would contain fiery, sulphurous pits and a great many gentlemen with forked tails. You were right about the last part. A demon is sitting behind a flame-proofed desk at the bottom of the stairs. There are some disconcerting screams from further away, but nothing to worry about. Not in this life, anyway."
! 117296 (0x1ca30): "That direction is not for the living."
! 117322 (0x1ca4a): "If you were to cast a film of your adventures so far, you would hire Donald Sutherland to play this gentleman."
! 117400 (0x1ca98): "Heaven, you always imagined, would be a world of marble pillars, fluffy clouds, harps and angelic ladies with serene expressions. You were right about the last part. An angel is sitting here behind some new office furniture, next to a blue Tourist Information sign. A bridge of cloud extends south across the sky to the beanstalk. There is some choral singing going on somewhere, but not loud enough for you to hear properly. Not in this life, anyway."
