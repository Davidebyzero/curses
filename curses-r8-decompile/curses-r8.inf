An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south."

Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney."

The mouse is quite large (almost a foot wide and tall), and has a big smile painted on its metal chassis. It has surprisingly modern circuitry in, though, and is even humming very faintly, so someone must have put some work in on it recently."

You peer at this with interest but nothing is within reach inside, and it is far too small for you to wriggle through. The cellars go back north, and so, it would appear, do you."

A narrow crevice opens out to an iron doorway and the warmth of the house.^^The rough stone floor levels out to a perfectly round, smooth white marble disc about five yards across, inscribed with a black lemniscus (or infinity) symbol.^^You shiver with foreboding, but inexplicably feel that the map you're looking for must be somewhere near here."

She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.^^An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you. A narrow staircase leads up and to the east into the attic.^^Jemima herself seems to be in the potting room to the west."

To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."
! 107598 (0x1a44e): "This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. A strange, more solid figure stands by a trestle table at the north end of the tent."
! 107850 (0x1a54a): "Beside the table is a more substantial adviser, as if she too walks in this strange spirit plane. She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect."

! 108254 (0x1a6de): "You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it."

The house rises up high above you to the south and you do not dare go east for fear of being recaptured by the rest of the family, so you'll have to go northwest, deeper into the gardens."

To the southeast is a stream, to the west is a small clearing and to the north a single break in the green privet hedge marks the entrance to the famously difficult Meldrew House Maze. A signpost reading ~To the Mosaic~ points east."

Still, there's a fine view out across the Mediterranean sea into the dim dawning sun. It's going to be a nice day, you can't help thinking.^^In the centre of the pinnacle is a marvellous device of polished bronze mirrors, its open end pointed out across the bay.

After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then only to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)

They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works. A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof, but nowhere near enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came."
