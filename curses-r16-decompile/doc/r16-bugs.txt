Giving anything to Joshua Meldew stops the daemon:

    if( action == ##Give or ##ThrowAt ) {
        remove noun;
        StopDaemon(self);
        if( noun == chicken_wishbone ) {
            move iron_key to Priest_s_Hole;
            give iron_key general;
            remove Sir_Joshua_Meldrewe;
            Achieved(SCORE_JOSHUA);
            "The ghost swallows the wishbone, grinning nastily. Then a look of consternation spreads across his face. He begins to choke and as he fades away, his arms flailing wildly, he lets go of the key, which sails through the air onto the roof and (against all odds) falls neatly down a chimney.";
        }
        print "The ghost swallows ";
        Defart(noun);
        " whole and grins!";
    }

So you can give him something useless, and take your leisure

>get key
As you reach for the key, a swirling mist condenses about it, into a ghostly head which opens its mouth and eats up the key!  The rest of the ghostly body
solidifies about the head and rises to swagger before you.

The ghost laughs in a gurgling kind of way, as it were always coughing and spluttering.

>give crumpled paper to ghost
The ghost swallows the crumpled piece of paper whole and grins!

Does the torch ever go out?

The daemon checks:
    if( self hasnt on ) {
        rfalse;
    }

but it's not turned on/off. It has light only

Ah, you can't get into the cupboard without changing it out, but it will never go out

Click!  The timer runs out, but the bomb was disarmed. You pocket the timer and hide the rest of the evidence under the table.

The clock is ticking downwards, and is right on the red zone!  None of the wires are plugged in.

>look at detonator
The timer seems quite simple to set. The clock is ticking downwards, and is right on the red zone!  None of the wires are plugged in.
