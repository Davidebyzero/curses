Still, it would be interesting to find out:^", "^  Just how realistic are the Tarot cards?^  What do sixth century politics have to do with you?^  Surely Greek myths can't come into this?^  What on earth is wrong with your entire family?^  Do the National Trust have sinister motives?^  Why is it so hard to go to church these days?^  What are daisies for?

To see what you have, type ~take inventory~ or just ~inventory~. You can move about with commands such as ~go west~, or just ~west~ for short. (It is assumed that you are blessed with an excellent sense of direction.)^^", "Some commands can act on more than one thing. You can ~drop all~, which will drop everything (except things you're wearing), for instance. Or if you found a packing case with a number of things in, you could type such things as:^^    remove everything but the blue key^    get all the coins except ten, twenty and fifty^^(Containers may also be emptied or emptied into each other.)  If you are not explicit enough, sometimes the game can infer what you mean, but at other times it will ask for further details.

If you don't mind which key, you can always say something such as:^^    drop a key into the slot^^and the game will make a sensible choice and tell you what it was.^^", "~Curses~ sometimes assumes commands which you implicitly make, but always tells you what they are in brackets. For instance:^^    >look up bach in book^    (first taking the Encyclopaedia of Composers)^    (putting the tuning fork in the rucksack to make room)^    ~J. S. Bach (1685-1750) had a pet aardvark called Nigel...^^", "~it~ refers to the last thing manipulated, ~him~ and ~her~ to anyone obvious in the room; ~pronouns~ will tell you what they currently mean, if in doubt. ~again~ repeats the last command.^^You can ~save~, ~restore~ or ~restart~ the game at any time, or indeed ~quit~ or ask for your ~score~, which also tells the time. ~fullscore~ or ~full~ gives a breakdown of the score. As an aide-memoire the command ~objects~ tells you where you left things you once had, and ~places~ says where you have been.

Amnesiac players, on the other hand, may like to use ~long~ (or ~verbose~) to give only long ones. Either kind can go back to the usual state of affairs with ~normal~ (or ~brief~).

You might well be able to get in a tractor, for instance, though driving it around might be harder.^^", "From time to time, you will wish to speak to other people.

The wooden floorboards seem fairly sound, just as well considering how heavy all these teachests are. But the old wiring went years ago, and there's no electric light."

Unfortunately, although he claimed to have hunted for evidence to the ends of the earth, he never could find a detail he wanted for volume I, and it was never published. Somehow, this typifies your family, and consulting this worthy book about your ancestors makes you realise what an uncanny knack they had for never quite achieving anything.^^Unless, of course, you count having an awful lot of children. So many Meldrews are listed here that you'll have to look them up individually."

! 189024 (0x2e260): "Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep."

But you just left the contractors to sort out all those boring fire prevention matters for themselves.^^They were a slap-dash firm, too, from what you remember. They put the little white thing high up, right in the middle of the Capricorn scene on the mural. And even if there was a fire, chances are it would be useless."

An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south."

The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north."

She has filled the place with objets trouves and bric-a-brac, and hung up a home-made calendar of watercolours. Even the old airing cupboard to the south is cluttered.^^An open doorway leads back southwest onto the upstairs landing, and you can hear the chaotic noise of suitcases being manhandled about - good thing nobody's seen you.

! 221840 (0x36290): "It is a summary of the writings of a polemical monk called Gildas, and relates to events following the fall of the tyrant Vortigern at the turn of the fifth century A.D. After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then chiefly to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)  Nobody even knows where Badon Hill is any more, or anything else about it, although some students of Welsh poetry believe Ambrosius was the source of the legend of King Arthur."

! 222692 (0x365e4): "The geography is strangely familiar here. You are on a natural shelf on the hillside, overlooking the valley below. An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.^^It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation."
! 222980 (0x36704): "The hillside is too steep."
! 222996 (0x36714): "You stand beside a Roman villa, whose columns cast shadows of an Empire in the moonlight. It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth. This villa has survived the pestilence and devastation of the civil war, and although it must be a couple of centuries old, it is still standing. From here you could cut across the hillside east to west, or slip in through a none-too-secure timber door."
! 223288 (0x36838): "A stream runs past the villa and cascades down the hillside here, to join the river far below, near the Roman road which will, in 1500 years time, become the motorway which so spoils the view from your back garden. A rough ladder of wood lashed together with leather rests against the villa at the lowest point of the tiled roof."
! 223480 (0x368f8): "You climb the ladder and are about to jump onto the roof when you catch sight of a man swaddled in animal furs, spreadeagled over the tiles, looking down into the central courtyard of the villa. He has a nasty-looking sword and since he hasn't seen you, you quietly shin back down the ladder again."
! 223652 (0x369a4): "The shadowy cloisters of the villa's atrium. You disturb a fieldmouse, and hear the scratching of tiny claws on stone. Moonlight filters in from the central courtyard to the south, and a rotten timber door leads back north."

! 223836 (0x36a5c): "The central well of the villa, ringed with columns. On the north side is a cloister and stone-linteled doorways lead east, south and west. The central floor area is commanded by a beautiful Roman mosaic, quartered into individual scenes, around the edges of which are vents from the hypocaust. There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight."

! 224624 (0x36d70): "You are clinging perilously to the walls of the deep and dangerous well. You can hardly see a thing, even with the aid of the torch, but curiously enough you feel warm air blowing across you from the east."
! 224736 (0x36de0): "Too risky. There might not be anything that way, for all you know."
! 224776 (0x36e08): "This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.^^A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by. The only way in seems to be the way you came."

You hide from sight, not wishing to draw attention to yourself. Up on the hill, where Meldrew Hall will one day be built, men on horseback can be seen circling the access track. For a deserted villa, this is certainly well-guarded."
! 225324 (0x3702c): "Well, here you are, imprisoned again. This time the cell is a tent of stitched animal hides, perhaps twenty feet in diameter, supported by a central pole. You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent."

! 225680 (0x37190): "Luckily for you the tent, now collapsed, was hardly being watched at all, because all the attention is diverted to a ghastly ritual being carried out over beyond the camp-fires. But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim."

! 225908 (0x37274): "An erratic glacial rock, which seems in the feverish firelight to make a natural dolmen, can be made out to the east, on the other side of an almost-extinguished campfire of hot coals."
! 226016 (0x372e0): "You stand beside the eerie dolmen, surrounded by the terrible noises and incantations of a druidic rite."

! 226184 (0x37388): "It is a frosty, clear night, but there is a scent of camp-fires burning in the distance. You are passing through the landscape as if a ghost, and all seems faintly unreal. To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."
! 226400 (0x37460): "This is the tent of a thin, reedy man who wears no uniform but has an obvious and commanding presence. He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent."
! 226612 (0x37534): "This is a kind of improvised shrine. A trestle table bears entrails, crude drawings sketched out on hide, and caged animals: draped beside it is a primitive tapestry of a bear reared up on its hind legs."

She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect."
! 227116 (0x3772c): "You can almost smell fear here. A motley platoon of soldiers are sitting about the embers of a fire. None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it."
! 227352 (0x37818): "A standing stone, perhaps a glacial erratic, stands here and on top of it is a shining blue stone, whose brightness almost blinds you. You feel irresistably drawn to it, and your hand reaches out..."
! 227476 (0x37894): "A strangely familiar, dusty passage, sloping down from a southern end bathed in hostile light to some kind of metal barrier in the north."

! 228152 (0x37b38): "The south wall forms a giant bronze mural, which has stood the test of time."
! 228196 (0x37b64): "The mural depicts an old bearded wise man following a star in the western sky. He has his right arm around an attractive young woman and holds a bundle of wands with his left hand. Around the border are astrological symbols of all kinds, from Tarot suits to zodiacal constellations."

You are stooped over inside a stone tomb, stained and crumbled with decay, broken only by a crevice you crawled in by. It is a nightmarish place."

Just such a contraption fills the west end of this room, though most of the workings are behind a glass wall which, although running with age, is as solid as the day it was built. The parts are very old (hand-made, not machined) but uncorroded.^^The only way out appears to be via the crawl to the east."
