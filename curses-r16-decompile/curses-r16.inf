He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then chiefly to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)

(This doesn't make your family rich aristocrats - just people who suffer very badly from inheritance tax.)^^Remember, your only aim is to find that map of Paris so you can go on holiday - try not to get diverted by any enormous quests. Still, it would be interesting to find out:^", "^  Just how realistic are the Tarot cards?^  What do sixth century politics have to do with you?^  Surely Greek myths can't come into this?^  What on earth is wrong with your entire family?^  Do the National Trust have sinister motives?^  Why is it so hard to go to church these days?^  What are daisies for?

To see what you have, type ~take inventory~ or just ~inventory~. You can move about with commands such as ~go west~, or just ~west~ for short. (It is assumed that you are blessed with an excellent sense of direction.)^^", "Some commands can act on more than one thing. You can ~drop all~, which will drop everything (except things you're wearing), for instance. Or if you found a packing case with a number of things in, you could type such things as:^^    remove everything but the blue key^    get all the coins except ten, twenty and fifty^^(Containers may also be emptied or emptied into each other.)  If you are not explicit enough, sometimes the game can infer what you mean, but at other times it will ask for further details. It might have replied to the first line above by saying^^    (from the yellow packing case)^^", "so that you know what has been assumed on your behalf. If there had been two blue keys you might reasonably have meant, it would reply with something like^^    Which do you mean, the blue doorkey or the Blue Moon Agency key?^^You may either tell it which, or else give up and do something else instead. If you don't mind which key, you can always say something such as:^^    drop a key into the slot^^and the game will make a sensible choice and tell you what it was.^^", "~Curses~ sometimes assumes commands which you implicitly make, but always tells you what they are in brackets. For instance:^^    >look up bach in book^    (first taking the Encyclopaedia of Composers)^    (putting the tuning fork in the rucksack to make room)^    ~J. S. Bach (1685-1750) had a pet aardvark called Nigel...^^", "~it~ refers to the last thing manipulated, ~him~ and ~her~ to anyone obvious in the room; ~pronouns~ will tell you what they currently mean, if in doubt. ~again~ repeats the last command.^^You can ~save~, ~restore~ or ~restart~ the game at any time, or indeed ~quit~ or ask for your ~score~, which also tells the time. ~fullscore~ or ~full~ gives a breakdown of the score. As an aide-memoire the command ~objects~ tells you where you left things you once had, and ~places~ says where you have been. ", "If you want to check that your copy of the game file is intact (and not, for instance, corrupted by some file-transfer process you used to get it), you can ~verify~ it. These commands do not take up any game time, and nor does anything the game didn't understand.^^", "Some jaundiced players tire of long descriptions of places, and they can type ~short~ (or ~superbrief~) to make the game only give short ones. Amnesiac players, on the other hand, may like to use ~long~ (or ~verbose~) to give only long ones. Either kind can go back to the usual state of affairs with ~normal~ (or ~brief~).

You might well be able to get in a tractor, for instance, though driving it around might be harder.^^", "From time to time, you will wish to speak to other people. If you only have a single word to say, you could use commands like^^    answer yes^    say boo to goose^^(Text in quotation marks is not allowed.)  The game will usually guess who you want to talk to if you miss off the name. A better way to talk, which allows more complicated remarks, is to use commands such as^", "^    goose, boo^    wine waiter, give me the bill^    ask professor about turtles^^though the waiter may have better things to do, and the professor might be quite mad. Some documents may be consulted in this game. For this, try commands such as^^    look up chlorine^    consult periodic table about argon^^", "You can give several commands in a row by use of ~then~ (or full stops, commas or ~and~ in some contexts): so, for instance,^^    e, s, get fish then inventory^    e.e.open door.s^^", "There are, of course, many other commands for more specialised circumstances.

Somehow, this typifies your family, and consulting this worthy book about your ancestors makes you realise what an uncanny knack they had for never quite achieving anything.^^Unless, of course, you count having an awful lot of children.

! 189024 (0x2e260): "Once upon a time, servants in great houses lived in awful little crevices and excuses for rooms like this one. They must have been in permanent danger of suffocation, for there are no windows and only a doorway to the west. A bed is still kept here, and the sight of it brings on drowsiness in all this warm stuffy air. All you want to do is curl up and sleep."

! 190636 (0x2e8ac): "Mounted on a plaque is an old sepia photograph of a man."
! 190672 (0x2e8d0): "The photograph is one of the very early ones which looks as if it was taken in the dark because the chemicals have gradually oxidised. The poor man in the frame (Mr Roger Meldrew, Esquire) looks as if he was propped up by a big clamp to hold him still for five minutes, and that's because he was."
! 190844 (0x2e97c): "It is attached to the ceiling."

! 190932 (0x2e9d4): "When you can get this working, perhaps you should take it somewhere prominent."
! 190980 (0x2ea04): "The kind of black box which often sits on top of a camera, used to illuminate otherwise dim scenes. It has an openable compartment on the side, with room left inside for a battery and a timer mechanism (which seem to be optional extras)."
! 191120 (0x2ea90): "A rather more modern photographer's flash lies on a shelf to one side."
! 191168 (0x2eac0): "Once upon a time, this small circular room had a dome and a telescope, but it leaked dreadfully and so now there's a proper roof.^^A circular mural painted with the signs of the zodiac is interrupted by a short flight of stairs leading up to the north, a smoke detector, a west doorway to a shadowy alcove and the continuation of the stairs down and to the south."
! 191384 (0x2eb98): "It isn't at all clear on what principle the detector works. It looks like a smoke detector, certainly. But you just left the contractors to sort out all those boring fire prevention matters for themselves.^^They were a slap-dash firm, too, from what you remember. They put the little white thing high up, right in the middle of the Capricorn scene on the mural. And even if there was a fire, chances are it would be useless."
! 191636 (0x2ec94): "Mounted on the old telescope stand is what looks like a solid glass ball."
! 191680 (0x2ecc0): "Once upon a time, the house library was used as a gun-room, and all the unwanted books kept up here. Now this is just another awkward cranny, with a water tank and some pipes in one corner which are something to do with the central heating."
! 191824 (0x2ed50): "From here, you can only squeeze back east to the observatory."
! 191860 (0x2ed74): "The joint on the water pipe looks none too sturdy."
! 191888 (0x2ed90): "Don't bother reading or thinking about it. Nothing to do with your family."
! 191936 (0x2edc0): "A romantic novel and a book of poetry are the only books left, and they're propping up a water pipe near a rather loose joint - it really is time you called a plumber to sort this one out."
! 192048 (0x2ee30): "~Coronets for the Cotton Girl~, by Miss Marie Swelldon, published London, 1912. It's all about the happy-go-lucky daughter of a Yorkshire mill owner and her adventures marrying into the aristocracy."

! 192260 (0x2ef04): "This is where you ought to have left the wretched map, in the family lumber-room of souvenirs and holiday snaps. You checked it thoroughly earlier, and can't bear the thought of searching it all again. A slide projector is aimed at the whitewashed south wall, one of the outside walls of the house. The only way to go is back up to the observatory."
! 192464 (0x2efd0): "It has an on/off switch on the side, and a slot for holding whatever is to be projected. There is also a little dial on the back, perhaps for the focus."

! 192556 (0x2f02c): "That is a difficult puzzle, yes."
! 192580 (0x2f044): "In the north wall is an open cupboard door, large enough to step inside."
! 192624 (0x2f070): "In the north wall is an intriguing closed cupboard door."
! 192660 (0x2f094): "The winding attic comes to a dead end here, and particularly dirty it is too, what with soot everywhere from the broken old chimney sweeping gear."
! 192748 (0x2f0ec): "It might be handy, if only it could carry anything."
! 192784 (0x2f110): "Great Scott!  That old canvas rucksack must be the very one your famous ancestor, the African explorer Ebenezer Meldrew, brought back from the Zambezi Expedition of 1882!"
! 192892 (0x2f17c): "On second thoughts, now you look at more closely, it seems to be the rucksack you bought to go to Paris with five years ago."
! 192968 (0x2f1c8): "A secret door stands open in the south wall!"
! 192996 (0x2f1e4): "The secret door is closed."
! 193012 (0x2f1f4): "A hatchway in the east wall, onto an old iron fire escape, is open and light floods in through it. (Some fool must have set the alarm off.)"
! 193100 (0x2f24c): "This is a surprisingly spacious cupboard, which you can't recall ever visiting before today. You really ought to use this convenient empty room for something..."
! 193196 (0x2f2ac): "Carry this with you everywhere you go."
! 193220 (0x2f2c4): "A large painting of Mad Isaac Meldrewe, your eighteenth-century ancestor, is propped up against the west wall."
! 193288 (0x2f308): "It used to hang in the downstairs landing, and the red, deranged eyes annoyed everybody who passed. Then Aunt Jemima picked up the ridiculous idea that it was by Sir Joshua Reynolds and had it valued. Happily it wasn't and, to cut a long story long, it ended up here."
! 193448 (0x2f3a8): "There is a big iron fireplace in the west wall."
! 193476 (0x2f3c4): "The medicine bottle, alas, was undamaged by the fall down the chimney."
! 193520 (0x2f3f0): "The skylight above is open, and the sky does indeed light the room."
! 193560 (0x2f418): "Above you is a blacked-out skylight with a crank handle."
! 193596 (0x2f43c): "It was painted out black during the first wave of Zeppelin air raids in World War I. This is completely irrelevant, but you did ask."
! 193680 (0x2f490): "The cork filters have gone. It's useless now."
! 193712 (0x2f4b0): "This is a recessed area of the roof, open to the skies but screened from below. There used to be a flagpole here, but not any more. An open skylight leads down, and a fairly safe catwalk leads northwest. However, the red-tiled roof is vertiginous and you have vertigo, which makes it especially annoying that there's an odd little balcony too far away to the south."
! 193932 (0x2f58c): "William Wordsworth once described poetry as emotion recollected in tranquillity. If so, hospitals must be full of people turning out verses about what it was like to fall off the roof of a high building. Perhaps it might be better not to join them."
! 194088 (0x2f628): "The old crenellated battlements of the house. An Englishman's home is, of course, his castle, but Meldrew Hall never saw much fighting and these military-looking features were just a seventeenth-century fashion. They also weren't intended for standing on, and the only safe way to proceed is back southeast.^^It is peculiarly cold here."
! 194296 (0x2f6f8): "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
! 194328 (0x2f718): "Unfortunately, what you need this for is up in the clouds."

! 194408 (0x2f768): "The chimney is cramped, sooty, unpleasant and has no floor to speak of, so you are held up only by jamming your feet against the walls. To the east, through the fireplace, is the cupboard."
! 194524 (0x2f7dc): "Not a chance!"
! 194536 (0x2f7e8): "Wedged loosely in beside you is a sooty old stick."
! 194568 (0x2f808): "It's exactly what it seems."
! 194588 (0x2f81c): "Good heavens, so the house has a priest hole after all!  It was always a family legend but nobody seemed to know quite where it was. Apart from a cross painted on one wall and a padded floor (to absorb the noise), this spartan cranny is featureless. Nevertheless there is a spooky air of the supernatural about... A narrow crawl leads up into the chimney."
! 194808 (0x2f8f8): "An open hatch-door in the wall at floor level reveals a chute leading down into darkness."
! 194868 (0x2f934): "Low down on one wall is a little hatch door, which if it were open would be large enough to enter."

! 195020 (0x2f9cc): "The dust and grime on the floor almost obscures an ancient prayer book."
! 195064 (0x2f9f8): "Despite appearances, this is not a prayer book after all but is Mad Isaac's diary of supernatural investigations!  The script is cursive and cursory as he rambles on through all those theories about the Curse. There's so much of it that you'd better just look up particular years."
! 195240 (0x2faa8): "There's just the secret north door, unless of course you count the windows."
! 195284 (0x2fad4): "Black-latticed windows open on a beautiful summer's day."
! 195324 (0x2fafc): "Blue sky can be seen through south-facing windows, latticed with black lead and shut tight."

! 195400 (0x2fb48): "There is a long vanity mirror beside the bed."
! 195428 (0x2fb64): "A tiny balcony around Miss Alison's windows, offering fresh air, blue skies and a magnificent view over the gardens down to the droning motorway in the distance. The roof is too perilous to scale even if you had a good reason (which you haven't), so you had better go back north."
! 195600 (0x2fc10): "The rooftop is far too dangerous in that direction."
! 195632 (0x2fc30): "You look down on a low, bare window-sill."

! 195716 (0x2fc84): "Gold and lead are naturally related, so you want to find a lead box to open."
! 195764 (0x2fcb4): "This small cavity at the north end of the attic once housed all manner of home-made wine paraphernalia, now lost and unlamented. Steps, provided with a good strong banister rail, lead down and to the west, and the banister rail continues along a passage east."
! 195916 (0x2fd4c): "Faded ink on the label reads: Elderberry '63."

! 196008 (0x2fda8): "Purely decorative."
! 196024 (0x2fdb8): "The good news is that it has excellent grid references, which are easy to look up. The bad news is that it is a map of central Hamburg."

After dark decades of pillage by Saxon mercenaries, Britain was reunited by Ambrosius Aurelianus and then defended at the Battle of Badon Hill, some time in the early years of the sixth century.^^This remarkable victory was of no religious significance, so Gildas does not dwell upon it. He tends only to mention bad kings and leaders, and then chiefly to insult them. (Talking about Gildas is an excellent way to annoy an Anglo-Saxon historian.)

An all-but invisible cleft in the rock leads to a cave to the southwest, and the slope can safely be traversed to the east.^^It is a brightly moonlit night, cool as in late spring. There will be a sharp frost tomorrow. Down in the valley, a great cartwheel circle of camp fires illuminate some dark shapes, perhaps crude encampments. There is no other sign of civilisation."

It is thirty years since the fall of the West, and Britain is cut off from the continent, where soon even the existence of the Anglis will become a myth.

There is no roof over the courtyard, and the atrium is lit by moonlight."

! 224776 (0x36e08): "This very low almost-cellar underneath the atrium is a tiny access space for log fires which are kept going to provide a form of central heating for the villa. They are lit and going away nicely, interestingly. It isn't very warm by twentieth-century standards, but you have to admit it works.^^A tiny amount of light filters in from the vents in the roof; just enough to see by.

You have no idea where the entrance is, because you were blindfolded on the way in. There is at least a dim light from the camp-fires outside the tent."

But your luck cannot hold for long. You are so surrounded by hostile territory that you simply have nowhere to run or hide. Things are, not to put too fine a point on it, looking grim."

To the east is one side of an animal-hide tent, but there is no way in from here. To southwest, some soldiers sit around the embers of a fire. There is a terrible sense of something about to happen."

He has an aquiline, patrician nose and, at five feet four, is taller than anyone else present. The others are advisers, junior officers, scheming politicians and their like. They are keeping their distance from a trestle table at the north end of the tent."

She is wearing frightening druidical robes, of strange pelts and furs, with nasty-looking charms around her neck. Every so often, she seems to catch sight of you out of the corner of her eye, but then look round and see nothing. The military men do not believe in her power, and yet... they treat her with respect."

None are talking or sleeping, and the false good humour of the evening has died away. At first light, you realise, there will be a battle. It isn't a risk you'd like to run in their place. And there is a strange light already in the east... not yet a dawn, for the soldiers seem unaware of it."
